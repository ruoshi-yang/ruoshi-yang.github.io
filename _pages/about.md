Thanks for visiting!

I am a MRes/PhD student in Quantitative Marketing at UCL School of Management, University College London. I hold an MA in Policy Research from University of Chicago and a BA in Economics from Wuhan University. My research interests primarily focus on digital platforms, behavioral economics and policy interventions. You could find my [CV](/files/CV_Ruoshi.pdf) here.

Always happy to chat!
